# 🔒 Zero-Knowledge Bribery Reporting Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 solution for combating corruption! This project enables individuals to report bribery incidents anonymously using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) on the Stacks blockchain. By leveraging Clarity smart contracts, reporters can submit verifiable evidence of bribery without revealing their identity or sensitive details, solving the real-world problem of whistleblower retaliation and underreporting in corrupt environments like government, corporate, or international aid sectors.

## ✨ Features

🔐 Anonymous submission of bribery reports via ZKPs  
🛡️ Verifiable proof of incidents without exposing personal data  
⏰ Immutable timestamped records for legal accountability  
💰 Reward system for validated reports to incentivize whistleblowing  
📊 Aggregated analytics on corruption trends (privacy-preserving)  
🚫 Anti-spam mechanisms to prevent false reports  
✅ Integration with authorities for secure report escalation  
🔄 Governance for community-driven updates to the system  

## 🛠 How It Works

This platform uses 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts to handle reporting, verification, rewards, and governance securely. ZKPs are generated off-chain (e.g., using tools like circom or snarkjs) and verified on-chain, ensuring privacy while maintaining blockchain integrity.

**For Reporters (Whistleblowers)**  
- Gather evidence of a bribery incident (e.g., transaction details, timestamps).  
- Generate a zero-knowledge proof that proves the incident occurred without revealing specifics (e.g., proving a bribe amount exceeds a threshold).  
- Call the `submit-report` function on the ReportSubmission contract with your ZKP and a hashed incident summary.  
- If validated, earn rewards from the bounty pool without linking to your identity.  

Boom! Your report is now on-chain, anonymously contributing to anti-corruption efforts.

**For Verifiers (Authorities or Auditors)**  
- Use `verify-report` on the ZKVerifier contract to confirm the proof's validity.  
- Access aggregated data via the Analytics contract for trends (e.g., bribery hotspots).  
- Escalate valid reports through the Escalation contract for off-chain action.  

**For Community Members**  
- Stake tokens in the Governance contract to vote on system parameters (e.g., reward amounts).  
- Contribute to the BountyPool contract to fund rewards for reporters.  

That's it! Secure, private, and impactful reporting in minutes.

## 📜 Smart Contracts Overview

The project involves 8 Clarity smart contracts, each handling a specific aspect of the system for modularity and security:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Manages anonymous user registrations (using STX addresses or pseudonyms) and access controls to prevent sybil attacks.  
2. **ReportSubmission.clar**: Handles the intake of ZKP-based reports, storing hashed summaries and emitting events for new submissions.  
3. **ZKVerifier.clar**: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs on-chain to ensure reports meet criteria (e.g., bribe validity) without revealing data.  
4. **BountyPool.clar**: Manages a pool of STX or tokens for rewarding validated reports, with automated distribution.  
5. **EvidenceStorage.clar**: Securely stores encrypted or hashed evidence linked to reports for future audits.  
6. **Analytics.clar**: Computes privacy-preserving aggregates (e.g., total bribes reported per region) using on-chain data.  
7. **Escalation.clar**: Allows authorized verifiers to flag reports for off-chain escalation, with audit trails.  
8. **Governance.clar**: Enables token holders to propose and vote on changes, like updating ZKP circuits or reward thresholds.  

These contracts interact seamlessly (e.g., ReportSubmission calls ZKVerifier for validation), ensuring the system is robust against tampering while solving privacy challenges in bribery reporting.
